## üìÇ Dataset Overview

* **Dataset Name:** Telecom Customer Churn Dataset
* **Records:** ~7,000 customers
* **Target Variable:** `Customer Status` ‚Äî {Stayed, Churned, Joined}
* **Objective:** Predict which customers are most likely to churn

**Key Features:**

* Demographics (Gender, Age, Dependents)
* Services (Internet Type, Security, Backup, Tech Support)
* Billing (Contract Type, Payment Method, Paperless Billing)
* Financials (Monthly Charges, Total Charges)
* Tenure (Months with the company)

## üîç EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis

### üßπ Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Removed irrelevant columns: `Churn Reason`, `Churn Category`.
* Handled missing values ‚Äî categorical: filled with **mode**, numeric: filled with **median**.
* Renamed columns and standardized column names.
* Created derived metrics: **Churn Rate**, **Total Revenue Lost**, **Monthly Revenue Lost**.

### üìä Key Observations from EDA

1. **Churn Distribution:** About 26% of customers have churned.
2. **Contract Type:** Month-to-Month contracts show the highest churn (>40%).
3. **Tenure:** Churn rate decreases steadily with longer tenure.
4. **Internet Type:** Fiber optic users are more likely to churn than DSL users.
5. **Billing & Payment:** Paperless billing and electronic payment methods are linked to higher churn.

## üîç Key Insights from Machine Learning

- **Tenure**, **Monthly Charges**, and **Contract Type** are the top predictors of churn.
- Customers with **fiber-optic internet**, **paperless billing**, and **month-to-month contracts** have higher churn probabilities.
- **Auto-pay customers** are more loyal and less likely to leave.
- About **20‚Äì25%** of the customer base falls into the **high-risk churn** segment (probability ‚â• 0.358).
- **Long-term contracts** (1-2 years) significantly improve retention
- **Tenure** and **total charges** are strong predictors of customer loyalty
- **Service bundling** (multiple lines, streaming) increases customer stickiness
- **High monthly charges** correlate with increased churn probability
